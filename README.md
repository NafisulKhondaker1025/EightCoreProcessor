# EightCoreProcessor
This is an 8-Core processor created for ECE 369 course final project. Each core contains a six stage pipelined datapath. 
It is based on 32-bit MIPS architecture and has been designed, implemented and validated on the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA.

The processor has been used to implement a video porcessing algorithm in MIPS ISA.
